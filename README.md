# Steps To Create Project From Scratch
1. Create two folder inside main folder.
   a. website - client side code / frontend will be written in react Js
   b. backend - server side code will be written here using node and express Js

2. Creating / initializing our react app as website-
   a. Go inside required folder and run:
      cd website
      
   b. Run to create app -
      npx create-react-app .

   c. Run your app -

      npm init [ref: https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html ]

   b. install dependencies / packages by running the following commands -
      npm install express
      npm install dotenv
      npm install mongoose
      npm install nodemon --save-dev
   
   c. create two file named as app.js and  server.js where we can write our code to start backend server

   d. Run your app -
